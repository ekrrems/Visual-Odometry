This is the New Tsukuba Stereo Dataset created at Tsukuba University's CVLAB.
(http://cvlab.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp)

It is aimed at serving as a benchmark to develop and evaluate computer vision
algorithms, such as stereo matching, camera tracking or structure from motion
algorithms.

It contains a CG-generated video sequence of 1 minute at 30 FPS (1800 frames 
in total) with 4 differnet illumination conditions. Additionally, several 
kinds of ground truth data are provided for evaluation.

For further details please refer to the following papers:

[1] "Realistic CG Stereo Image Dataset with Ground Truth Disparity Maps", 
Martull et al., TrackMark 2012.

[2] "Towards a Simulation Driven Stereo Vision System",
Peris et al., ICPR2012.

We grant permission to use and publish all the contents of this datset for
Research and Educational purposes. However, if you use our datset, we kindly 
request that you cite the associated papers: [1] and [2].

To use the dataset for purposes other than Research and Education, please
contact Prof. Kazuhiro Fukui (kfukui@cs.tsukuba.ac.jp).

Contents of the dataset:

NewTsukubaStereoDataset/README -> This file

NewTsukubaStereoDataset/illumination/daylight -> Rendered color images for left
	and right camera under daylight illumunation. 1800 images per camera 
	in PNG format.

NewTsukubaStereoDataset/illumination/flashlight -> Rendered color images for
	left and right camera under flashlight illumination. 1800 images per
	camera in PNG format.

NewTsukubaStereoDataset/illumination/fluorescent -> Rendered color images for
	left and right camera under fluorescent illumination. 1800 images per
	camera in PNG format.

NewTsukubaStereoDataset/illumination/lamps -> Rendered color images for left 
	and right camera under lamps illumination. 1800 images per camra in 
	PNG format.

NewTsukubaStereoDataset/groundtruth/depth_maps -> Ground truth depth maps for
	left and right camera. 1800 images per camera in Portable Float Map 
	format (PFM). The units of each value is expressed in centimiters 
	(cm).

NewTsukubaStereoDataset/groundtruth/disparity_maps -> Ground truth disparity 
	maps for left and right camera. 1800 images per camera in PFM format.

NewTsukubaStereoDatset/groundtruth/occlusion_maps -> Occlusion mask for left
	and right camera. 1800 images per camera in PNG format. White color
	represents pixel visible in both cameras, black color represents pixel
	not visible in current camera.

NewTsukubaStereoDataset/groundtruth/discontinuity_maps -> Near discontinuity 
	area mask for left and right camera. 1800 images per camera in PNG 
	format. White color represents pixel near a depth-discontinuity area,
	grey color represents pixel visible in both cameras, black color 
	represents pixel not visible in current camera.

NewTsukubaStereoDataset/groundtruth/camera_track.txt -> Ground truth position
	of the stereo camera (relative to the middle point of the stereo 
	camera's baseline). 1800 poses (one for each frame). Each line contain
	6 float values: X Y Z A B C. Where (X, Y, Z) is the 3D position of the
	camera nad (A, B, C) are the Euler angles (in degrees) that represent
	the camera orientation.

The resolution of the images is 640x480 pixels, the baseline of the stereo 
camera is 10cm and the focal length of the camera is 615 pixels.
